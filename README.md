# SCION Workshop

SCION is a next generation, clean slate technology to address some of the fundamental security issues with the Internet. Path Aware Networking (PAN), a feature of SCION, allows multiple paths to be available simultaneously for selection by the application or end user when a network connection is originated. One, or more paths, can be selected based upon a multitude of technical, business, and compliance/regulatory metrics or needs (i.e. bandwidth, latency, hops, MTU, price, must stay in EU, etc).

We have two workshops available. The first is a 60 minimum workshop utilizing pre-deployed SCION hosts allowing the attendee to quickly dive into the SCION basics and learn its benefits of SCION. The second is a 180 minute deeper dive giving the attendee a chance to see a little deeper behind the scenes. If you are attending an in-person workshop, you'll be notified if it is a 60 minute or a 180 minute workshop.
